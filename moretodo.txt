Procedural Maze
Maze walls and stuff?
Hit points
Buffs (extra lives etc)
spawner visibility
Doors open if condition met

collectibles need to look for player i think, not anything?? somethign wrong with collision

you win message

misc trigger zones (eg walking over an area makes something else happen; even a checkpoint)

configurable death/finish length (eg less/more/no slomo delay on finish/death)

Spawns detect "walls" differently (ie dont clip through, nor get collected or something)
